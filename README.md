# Leaflet-part-1-Updated

This project is a web-based visualization of earthquake data using Leaflet.js. It displays earthquake locations on a map, with markers reflecting the magnitude and color indicating the depth of each earthquake. Popups provide additional information when markers are clicked, and a legend offers context for the map data.
